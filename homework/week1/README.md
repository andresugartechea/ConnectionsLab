## Week 1:

### Class I, pt.1 | January 25th: Pick a connected application of your choice. It can be from the list we looked at in class or otherwise. Write a 300-500 word critique on the application. What do you think works? What doesn't? What would you like to do differently? This has to be available on your GitHub.

The connected application that was the most appealing for me was [_“Connected Worlds”_](https://classic.nysci.org/experiencenysci/exhibits/connected-worlds/) by NYSCI for its subject-matter, that is sustainability, and for its location in New York. The concept of this app is to give the user the experience of living in multiple ecosystems while being responsible for their preservation. The goal is to make the audience aware of the impact that their actions can have on the environment, creating interactive sequences with animations that continue in function of the decisions of the user.

From the advertisement on their website and its aesthetics, I deduce that the target audience for this application is mainly kids and adolescents. The animation of the flaura and fauna are fanciful, which I consider a good approach to make the application attractive for children, especially when talking about a topic difficult or boring to explain like sustainability.  Appart from its appearance, I think what works really well is displaying the application in a wide and big panoramic space, so it creates an even more immersive illusion of being inside of the animation. The variety of possible interactions diversifies the experiences and allows users to have each one an interpretation of the application.

However, I think what doesn’t work for this application is that the same type of aesthethics that are attractive for a young audience might be unappealing for an older one, which would limit its reception and impact. From my point of view, when a topic is treated with a tone for kids it substracts seriousness and importance. I think this could be fixed by changing the animation, with animals and ecosystems that look more similar to the real world. In addition to this, I think I’d be fantastic to have something to interact with out of the screen, like buttons or levers that complement the interactivity.
