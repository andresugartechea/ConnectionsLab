            <p><i>"SSINY"</i> is an interactive painting working with sensors on Arduino, and reproduced and drawn on Processing. The serial communication between these two software allows the user to participate in the making of this piece. The purpose of this project is to reinforce the melancholic tone of the original painting through the interactivity provided by the sensors, adding sound, movement, animation and playing with the color palette.</p>
