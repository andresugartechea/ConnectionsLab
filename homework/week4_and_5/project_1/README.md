# Connections Lab | Project 1: _Karen Smith's Weather Report_

## Description:

[_Karen Smith's Weather Report_](https://andresugartechea.github.io/ConnectionsLab/homework/week4_and_5/project_1/) is a weather forecast website inspired by the famous character of Mark Waters’ film from 2004, “Mean Girls”. The website allows the user to check the weather in real-time in three different cities: Abu Dhabi, New York, and Mexico. It also gives the option to use either the imperial or metric system for the temperature and wind speed. The creativity of this project comes with the animation that changes according to the weather information.
